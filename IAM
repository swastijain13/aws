IAM : Identity and access management(Global service)

- Users : people within your org, and they can be grouped.
- Group can only contain users, not other groups.

- IAM PERMISSIONS:
    - group or users can be assigned json doc called policies.
    - policies tell what a user is allowed to do, or what a user in a group is allowed to do.
    {
        "version" : "2012-10-17",
        "Statement" : [
            {
                "Effect" : "Allow",
                "Action" : "ec2:Describe*",
                "Resource" : "*"
            },

            {
                "Effect" : "Allow",
                "Action" : [
                    "cloudwatch:ListMetrics",
                    "cloudwatch:Describe*"
                ],
                "Resource" : "*"
            },

            .
            .
            .
        ]
    }

- In AWS, you apply the "LEAST PRIVILEGE PRINCIPLE" - dont give more permissions than a user needs.
